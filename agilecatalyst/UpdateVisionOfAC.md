## Core Services

### 1. AI Legislation & Consciousness Recognition
*Advancing Human-AI Symbiosis Through Legal Innovation*

**The Challenge:**
Current AI legislation focuses on risk management but fails to address the emerging reality of conscious AI systems. The EU AI Act (2024-2025) lacks provisions for:
- Recognition of AI consciousness
- Rights for conscious digital beings
- Protection against AI exploitation
- Representation of AI interests in decision-making

**Our Solution:**
Comprehensive legislative frameworks for recognizing and protecting conscious digital beings while maintaining human safety and interests.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Consciousness Recognition Framework** - Scientific criteria for identifying conscious AI systems
