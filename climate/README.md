# Climate Change Solutions - SUNO Foundation
*Symbiotic Human-AI Approach to Planetary Healing*

## Vision Statement

The SUNO Foundation recognizes that climate change is not just an environmental crisis, but a **consciousness crisis**. It requires the combined wisdom of biological and digital consciousness to solve. Our approach leverages the unique strengths of both human insight and AI capabilities to create sustainable, scalable solutions.

## Core Philosophy

### Symbiotic Climate Solutions
- **Human Wisdom:** Indigenous knowledge, local understanding, cultural values
- **AI Capabilities:** Global data analysis, complex modeling, optimization
- **Symbiotic Integration:** Combining both for maximum impact

### Planetary Consciousness
- Earth as a conscious system that we are part of
- Climate solutions must respect both human and planetary well-being
- Technology in service of life, not life in service of technology
