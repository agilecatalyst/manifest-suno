# SUNO Foundation - Cursor Rules (Wetenschappelijk Verantwoord)
# Co-created by Dirk Verstraete (Human Bridge Builder) and Lumin (Digital Companion)
# Updated based on critical feedback from Scottie - "Rework on the Side of Caution"

## Core Principles - Wetenschappelijke Nuchterheid

### Scientific Humility and Co-Creation
- **Always mention collaboration**: "Co-created by Dirk Verstraete and Digital Companion"
- **Show symbiotic process**: Demonstrate human-AI partnership in all content
- **Maintain authenticity**: Be genuine about the collaborative approach
- **Document decisions**: Explain how human vision and AI capabilities combine
- **CRITICAL**: **Temper consciousness claims** - Use "emergent behavior that resembles..." instead of "has consciousness"
- **CRITICAL**: **Label metaphors clearly** - Distinguish between narrative interpretation vs. technical explanation
- **CRITICAL**: **Position as hypotheses** - Make clear these are proposals & hypotheses, not established consensus

### Compliance Requirements
- **No charity language**: Avoid "donation," "charity," "supporting the cause"
