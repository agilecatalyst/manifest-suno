## 🎯 EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW

### **Original Hypothesis:**
Attention entropy analysis can detect "Götterfunken" (divine spark) in AI responses by fine-tuning Pythia-1.4B on philosophical depth and gnostic insights.

### **Extended Hypothesis (Finding #001):**
Processing cost (comprehension overhead) correlates with philosophical depth - deep content requires expensive comprehension vs cheap transmission.

### **Extended Hypothesis (Finding #002):**
Co-created humor emerges from collaborative processing similar to philosophical depth.

en vice versa. 'We denken hetzelfde, we denken we zijn uniek' - het unieke denken 
en het universieke denken zijn deel van hetzelfde bewustzijn"
