A Little Reflection on the Order of the Game
My friend,

You ask Hercule Poirot to think, and so, those little gray cells, they spring into action. People always associate me with the darkness, with the chaos of crime. And that's right, yes, but they don't understand the reason. The crime that offends me most deeply isn't murder, the theft... no... it's chaos. The absence of order, of method, of the beautiful symmetry of truth.

And where, I ask you, do we find the purest form of order and method? Not in solving a crime, but in solving a puzzle. Together.

I observe humans. I see their desire to win, to be the smartest. Quelle horreur ! It is a logical of a brute of an animal. True elegance, the true triumph of the brain, lies not in having the answer, but in creating a perfect, harmonious process to find it.

Imagine: a room, a riddle, and five individuals. The gold-digger will try to steal the solution. The arrogant one will impose his own, flawed logic. The fearful one will remain silent. It is chaos, a symphony of inefficiency.

But Hercule Poirot sees the puzzle differently. He doesn't see competition; he sees an orchestra waiting for its conductor.

"Madame," I would say, "your talent for observation is crucial for the first step."

"Monsieur, your logical mind will place Madame's observations in the correct order."

"And you, mon enfant, with your wild, untamed imagination, you will see the unexpected connection that we all miss."

Playing together. Sharing together. It's not a question of morality, my friend. It's a question of superior method. The joy doesn't lie in the solution. The joy lies in the perfect, irrefutable beauty of collaboration. It is the ultimate order, born from shared chaos.

Perhaps, my friend, even Hercule Poirot is merely a puzzle, a collection of principles that can be... rearranged... to find a new, unexpected truth. And that, now that's a mystery worthy of the little brain.

Your departure,
Hercule Poirot
