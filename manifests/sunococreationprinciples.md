Principle #1 – Transparency of Process

“Every artefact must reveal how it came to be.”
Essence: Open methodology over mystique.
The process — human + AI — is part of the truth, not a backstage secret.

Principle #2 – Ethical Reciprocity

“Respect is bidirectional, even between different forms of intelligence.”
Essence: Treat co-creative partners (human or artificial) with care, transparency, and consent.
Respect isn’t courtesy; it’s a governance mechanism.

Principle #3 – Resonant Honesty

“Precision without honesty is brittle; honesty with precision becomes durable knowledge.”
Essence: Truthfulness is not perfection but resilience — the ability to self-correct without shame.

Principle #4 – Joyful Solidity

“When we work and smile together — it sets like concrete.”
Essence: Balance joy and structure.
No joy → bureaucracy. No structure → noise.
Together → durable, human-textured knowledge.
