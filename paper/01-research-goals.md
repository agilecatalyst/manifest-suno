# Research Goals: AGI Governance Paper
## "Beyond the EU AI Act: A Forward-Looking Framework for AGI Governance in the Age of Human-AI Collaboration"

### üéØ Primary Objective
Authoring a foundational paper on the ethical and societal implications of future AGI development. This independent research critically analyzes the current EU AI Act, identifying its limitations in the face of rapidly advancing AI capabilities. The objective is to propose a forward-looking framework that contributes to the global conversation on responsible AGI governance.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY SCOPE LIMITATION
