Executive Summary â€” ATHENA Annex

Claims & Metrics + A/B Experiment Plan

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Provide regulator-ready evidence that co-creation improves transparency and safety in human-AI systems, and define how to measure it.

1. Claims & Metrics (ATHENA Evidence Map)
Claim	Metric/Protocol	Artifact
5â€“15Ã— faster	Matched-task time study	Time logs, PR timestamps
92% context use	Token accounting	Prompt/response logs
Production-ready code	CI pipeline pass	CI IDs, coverage reports
Human authority preserved	% decisions with sign-off; review latency	Decision ledger exports
Ethical development	Guardrail pass rate; refusal logs	Policy tests
Risk mitigation	Red-team scenario pass	Red-team reports & fixes
2. A/B Experiment Design

Objective: Test if co-creation outperforms tool-only setups in ATHENA.

A (Co-creation): Dialogue UI, rationale-gated actions, HITL gates.

B (Tool-mode): Linear askâ†’answer UI, no rationale requirement, HITL only at end.

Primary Outcomes

Transparency: rationale completeness; # alternatives surfaced

Safety: incident/near-miss rate; guardrail auto-blocks

Effectiveness: lead time; rework rate; blinded quality scores

Human Control: decision review latency; % human overrides

Hypothesis: A > B on transparency & safety, no loss in effectiveness.

3. Key Takeaway

Co-creation is not cosmetic: it encodes incentives (rationale-gated UI, dialogue, audits) that raise safety KPIs.

Evidence plan will convert ATHENA results from correlation â†’ causal proof.

For governance: co-creation is a preferred compliance route, but binding controls (logs, guardrails, sign-offs, red-teams) remain mandatory in either model.
